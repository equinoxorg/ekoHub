1. The low pass filter filter has a cutoff frequency of 72Hz. This comes from the pormula f = 1/(2*pi*R*C) where R = 100k and C = 22nF.

2. The output at the initial potential divider is approximately 4V pk-pk. Changing R6 makes no difference in the pk-pk Voltage at the diodes.R5 makes the difference.

3. At the output, Vout is 3V pk-pk with the signal 0.4 V away from the GND rail
