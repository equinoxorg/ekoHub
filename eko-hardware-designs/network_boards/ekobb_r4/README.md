Network Board Revision 4
========================

*The ekobb_r4 designation is a holdover from the 2010/2011 naming scheme*

The Revision 4 board is a major update from Revision 3 which was an incremental update. The following changes will be made:
* Migration to the PIC24FJ64GA004 with PPS (Remappable Pins)
* Provision of a DIP switch for Modbus address configuration (4 bits)
* Migration to the 3.3V SP3483E RS485 line driver (removes the need for the 74LVC07)
* Replace 8P8C modular connectors with Phoenix Contact PTSM series connectors
* Add footprint for sub 1W, 12V -> 5V buck converter
* Add footprint for 3.3V power switch (FET) and external UART connector
* Consolidate Analogue and Digital IO expansion to ANx, UART, SPI and I2C
